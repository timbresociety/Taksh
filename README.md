# Taksh

Type a game idea, or pick one of nine games, then play it with your body through a webcam. Every game is a template, so its world, characters and art style can all be changed. 0G, Arkiv and ENS come in a later pass.

## Run it

```bash
npm install
npm run setup          # copies the MediaPipe runtime and fetches the pose models into public/
cp .env.example .env.local   # add ANTHROPIC_API_KEY for real generation
npm run build && npm start   # or: npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000. The input lab is at `/debug`. `/debug/rig` shows the characters, and `/debug/stage?template=hop&world=moon&style=toon` plays any combination with its bot.

Without a key the app runs on fixtures and says so on screen. Fixtures match keywords against the game templates, so they exercise the runtime and UI but show nothing about how well a model reads an idea.

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `npm test` | Unit tests, plus regression tests on real-footage landmarks |
| `npm run models` | Lists the Claude models this project's credentials can reach |
| `npm run eval` | Runs the prompt set through the pipeline and saves results to `evals/results/` |
| `npm run eval -- --model <id>` | Runs the same set on a second model |
| `npm run e2e` | Plays all nine games with real key presses in headless Chrome, across every world and style, and measures the picture. Needs a server on port 3100: `npx next start -p 3100` |
| `npm run assets` | Rebuilds `public/assets` from the source packs. See `assets/README.md` |
| `npm run previews` | Recaptures the stills on the game shelf and pickers from the real renderer. Needs a running app: `PORT=3100 npm run previews` |
| `npm run replay -- <trace.json>` | Replays a trace saved from the input lab |

## The games

Each game is an original template with its own name, characters, art and levels. Each input is the nearest range-of-motion exercise.

| Template | Game | Your body | Keys |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `lane_runner` | Lane Dash | Side step, jump or high knee, squat | `←` `→` `↑` `↓` |
| `hop` | Sky Hop | Squat to charge, stand to launch | Hold `Space` |
| `rally` | Baseline Rally | Overhead reach to toss, arm swing | `W` `A` `D` |
| `pads` | Pad Rounds | Jab, cross, hook, uppercut | `J` `K` `U` `I` |
| `bout` | Counter Bout | Punches, side lean, squat, guard | `J` `K` `A` `D` `S` `Space` |
| `flyer` | Wing Beat | Lateral arm raise, then beat down | `Space` |
| `reps` | Speed Pump | Alternating arm pump | `←` `→` |
| `poses` | Mirror Match | Hold the pose your character shows | `1` to `0` |
| `guard` | Lane Guard | Side step | `←` `→` |

A spec is `template + skin + tuning`. The skin picks one of six worlds (downtown, forest, station, moon, village, sunset), one of six art styles (bright, toon, neon, pixel, comic, clay), and the look of the hero and rival. Tuning is a set of bounded numbers per template. Levels come from a seed, so a model only ever chooses from these lists and can't produce something unplayable.

The camera only works on `http://localhost` or an HTTPS address. The `Network` address Next.js prints is plain HTTP, so browsers block the camera there. Another device needs an HTTPS address.

## Model and prompts

**Not chosen yet.** No credentials were configured, so no prompt has been sent to a real model.

- Provisional default: `claude-opus-5-5`, set in `src/lib/pipeline/provider-claude.js`. Override it with `TAKSH_MODEL`.
- Effort: `low` for intent, `medium` for generate and revise.
- Prompts: `prompts/intent.v2.md`, `prompts/generate.v2.md`, `prompts/revise.v2.md`. Versions are set in `src/lib/pipeline/prompts.js`. The list of templates, worlds, styles and tuning ranges is injected from `src/lib/spec/contract.js`.
- Requests use server-side refusal fallback (`fallbacks: "default"`). Remove it from `provider-claude.js` if you don't want it.

To settle this, add a key and run `npm run eval`. It checks each case for idea preservation, validity, playability and speed, against a budget of 8s for intent and 30s for generate or revise. If Opus misses the time budget, that is the reason to compare a second model with `npm run eval -- --model claude-haiku-5-5`.

## What was tested

**No person has played this on a webcam yet.** The FaceTime camera on the build machine was not used. Movement was tested by feeding video files to Chrome as a fake camera, which runs the real capture, local MediaPipe, calibration and gesture code.

**The exercises the new games depend on are only proven on synthetic bodies:** squat, lean, punch, hook, uppercut, swing, overhead reach, flap, arm pump, guard and all ten poses. Run the drill below before trusting them. Punches depend on MediaPipe's depth estimate, which is the weakest of these.

| Movement | Evidence | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Burpee | Real footage, two people | 7 of 7 counted once, none lost tracking |
| Hand out | Real footage, arms during jumping jacks | Fires, but this is not a deliberate punch test |
| Step left and right | Real person's image panned by ffmpeg | Correct order, small sway ignored |
| Jump | Real person's image panned by ffmpeg | 2 of 2 |
| Kick, high knee | Synthetic bodies only | Passes in tests, unproven on real movement |
| Every new exercise above | Synthetic bodies only | Passes in tests, unproven on real movement |
| Holds and hovering count once | Synthetic bodies, confirmed to fail without hysteresis | Pass |

Also confirmed on the production build:

- Keyboard flow: all nine games played with real key presses across all six worlds and styles, with each picture measured so a blank canvas fails. Also a full round, a revision with a measured change, an idea setting its world and style, one clarifying question, and an unsupported idea both accepted and changed.
- Camera flow on footage, through Lane Guard: calibration, tracking through a full round with no false pause, revise, and replay without recalibrating. The footage is burpees and jumping jacks, so it proves the path, not the new exercises. The pause and resume check from the first slice was not repeated on the new stage.
- Pose tracking reported 27 to 31 frames per second and about 15ms inference on the GPU delegate. Those figures came from headless Chrome on the build machine and a 640x360 feed. Measure again on the demo laptop.

## Measure on the demo laptop

1. Open `/debug`, start the camera, and stand two to three metres back.
2. Run the drill. Each move is prompted six times, and the table counts missed inputs, double counts, wrong moves and moves between prompts.
3. Save the results and the trace. A trace can be replayed with `npm run replay` and added to `test/traces/` as a regression test.
4. Tune `THRESHOLDS` in `src/lib/motion/gestures.js` if needed.

## How it fits together

- `src/lib/spec`: the versioned `GameSpec` contract, its validator, revision comparison and starter specs.
- `src/lib/templates`: the nine games as pure logic with no drawing or camera, each with a bot, so they can all be played in a test.
- `src/lib/motion`: pose feed, calibration and gesture recognition. Thresholds scale to the player's torso length. A game listens only for the moves it binds, and arm games calibrate without seeing the legs.
- `src/lib/pipeline`: clarify, generate and revise, with validation and one repair attempt. Credentials stay on the server.
- `src/lib/stage`: the three.js renderer. `worlds.js` and `styles.js` are data plus one post-processing pass, `views/` draws each template, and `character.js` builds a rigged human whose 65-bone skeleton plays every clip in the animation library.

## Known limits

- A punch at the camera is read from MediaPipe's depth estimate and has not been tried on a real person.
- The base bodies come only in superhero proportions in the free tier, so sportswear is painted on in a shader, and the feet are painted rather than modelled as shoes.
- High knees and jumps are separate gestures, and both can bind to "up". A burpee counts when the hands reach the floor, not when the player stands back up.
- GPT and Google Flow image generation are not wired in. Art comes from the CC0 kits, and only 11 of the 82 CC0 Quaternius packs are in. See `assets/README.md`.
- The game rendering moved from Canvas 2D to three.js, because a human rig needs WebGL. The first load of a game fetches 12 to 15 MB of models.
- Pose inference runs on the main thread.
- The API routes have no rate limit, so add one before any public deployment.
